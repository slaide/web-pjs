# web-pjs
web frontend framework for a reactive UI, called ```p.js```

# why?

this framework is quite similar to vue.js v2, which was (to my knowledge) a purely client-side js framework.
It did fulfill most of my requirements in a frontend framework, but some things were major issues, like performance.
This framework is developed in tandem with a web frontend for a scientific microscope.
